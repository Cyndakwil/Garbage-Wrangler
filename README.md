# Garbage Wranger
### Hack The Earth 2021 Project
## Description
Garbage Wrangler is a Unity game in which you take control of a submarine in the deep ocean. Your objective is to pick up nearby floating pieces of garbage to prevent nearby sea life from being harmed by it. You gain points for successfully picking up garbage and you lose health every time a fish comes into contact with garbage and dies. We believe this game is a great way of spreading awareness by showing the impact garbage has on sea life and the way the sea comes to look if it becomes littered in garbage
